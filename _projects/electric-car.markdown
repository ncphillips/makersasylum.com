A team of 4 youngsters from the NMIMS Institute joined the Makerâ€™s Asylum space to build their swanky fuel efficient car running on gasoline with an average efficiency of 25 km/hr to set their ideas flying to Singapore for the Shell Eco Marathon, 2017. This self-funded initiative by this bunch of enthusiasts saw light of day at our space and built beautifully under the guidance of our Lab leaders and tool trainers.
