In this installation the artist depicts the simplicities as well as the complexities of mother earth through the use of various abstract elements. The towering installation provokes viewers to think about how focused the world is on material objects, in this day and age. We are merely a combination of gears; we can move around, but humanity is now cold, devoid of empathy, and not really interacting.

The artist, Priyank Rangparia from ‘BEFUSE’ has detailed out the metal world map using automobile scrap parts, thus upcycling and giving purpose to scrap elements which are otherwise covered in grease and not given a second thought as they rust away at the bottom of a scrapyard. The installation was made at Maker's Asylum, Mumbai, and was displayed at the Kala Ghoda Festival.
