This team converted a 3D printer into a braille embosser that was then used to solve the objective of creating a braille map of Makerâ€™s Asylum. It took the team and its mentors several iterations to figure out the perfect hack to make the map. The final map got very accurate feedback thanks to the combination of laser cut elevations, different textures, and braille engravings
