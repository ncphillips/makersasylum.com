Teacher-Feels is a system that can be integrated into education institutions to help track and improve mental health of educators. The system involves asking teachers to input their post-class mood into meters setup in all classrooms. Inputs are recorded and accessed through an app and the data is sent to the principle or a dedicated mood-board to provide assistance when necessary.
