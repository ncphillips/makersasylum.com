We built an installation for VAT 69 using Laser etched Acrylic and LED lights. Check out the video to understand how it looks. It has a matrix of leds that light up in a sequence and the the etched Acrylic diffracts the light to create this effect. 
This installation was made for homegrown magazine for the international scotch day party in Mumbai. 
The project was made by Jezreel Nathan, Jesal Mehta and Vaibhav Chhabra
