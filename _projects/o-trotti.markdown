Although called e-Trotti, the original open source project was modified to an open source low cost electric mobility hack called O-Trotti. This project allows users to convert their standard wheelchairs to electric ones at a fraction of the cost associated with buying brand name products. The hack involves disassembling and modifying an electric scooter to be attached to any standard wheelchair.
