Team Wasted developed a waste segregation bin that helps inculcate better awareness among users with regards to the amount of solid waste generated. By gamifying the process of segregation and connecting sensors in the actual bin to an app, the idea is to allow you to track and compare waste statistics with friends and neighbors in an attempt to move towards societies that generate zero waste.
