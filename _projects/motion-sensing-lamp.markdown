This was designed and made at the Asylum in 48 hours, by our resident makers - Coby and Ankush. 
The lamp was designed on Autodesk Fusion 360. Then laser cut using the laser cutter at the Asylum. It houses an Arduino connected to a motion sensor, that greets visitors coming into the Asylum by turning on the lights.
