MegaMind is a peer-to-peer interactive learning module situated on a bus, aimed at stimulating scientific curiosity among children between the ages of five and ten. It is composed of an interactive installation powered by micro learning thematic units. The bus can be parked at schools, public parks, and housing societies and will feature constantly changing themes. Furthermore an app analyzing the experience of children on the Childrenâ€™s Science Curiosity Scale (CSCS) can be integrated to monitor growth and interest.
