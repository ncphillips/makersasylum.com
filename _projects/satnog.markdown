The SatNOG built at the space is an open source collaborative project that tracks the satellites within their bandwidth, communicates and gathers information from them. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are our priority, and for a good reason. Hundreds of interesting projects worth of tracking and listening are happening in LEO and SatNOGS provides a robust platform for doing so.
