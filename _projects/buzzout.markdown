BuzzOut is an ear health kit and tracker that includes a wearable wrist device that notifies the user when they are exposed to harmful sound levels. At this point of time, the user can then use the provided noise cancelling earplugs or earbuds to protect them from the risk of Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).
