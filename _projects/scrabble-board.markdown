Namita designed this leather, wood and jute travel scrabble. The idea was to gift it to a friend who loved scrabble as much as she loved travelling. So the entire set had to be really portable, and made of material that wouldn't wear and tear easily. The board and tiles were custom designed and laser cut, whilst the carry-tube and pouch was hand-stitched.
