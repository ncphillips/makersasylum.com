Three of the top five noisiest cities in the world are in India and the biggest reasons are poor driving etiquettes and incessant honking. Honkbusters have developed a staged traffic signal system that will help in herding traffic based on the number of vehicles in front of them. Additionally, they developed a noise-meter prototype for hospitals that indicates the ambient noise level and promotes quieter environments.
