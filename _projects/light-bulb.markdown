The Light Bulb Project is a low cost, stationary cycle and flywheel based tool that enables remote and underprivileged areas to convert kinetic energy to electrical energy that can be stored in pre-existing lead acid batteries. The setup involves 75 minutes of pedaling to generate roughly 150-watt hours of energy, enough to power a light bulb for 8 hours and a fan for 24 hours.
