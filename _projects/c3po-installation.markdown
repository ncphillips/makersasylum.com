The C3PO is an interactive origami based installation that was built at the Asylum. The outside was all origami, while on the inside, it had electronic sensors and 3D printed parts that allowed it to move. This was showcased at GLF 2015 - Godrej's annual leadership event in their campus in Vikroli, Mumbai. 
This was built by Himanshu Agrawal (Origami artist), Hemal Chelvi (Electronics engineer), Rupin Chedda(Maker Educator), Vaibhav Chhabra (Mechanical Engineer), Sunil Gogia(Spray painting artist)
