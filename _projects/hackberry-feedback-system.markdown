The Hackberry Feedback System is fitted with temperature and pressure sensors that give feedback to the user regarding the state of the object that they’re holding! The pressure sensor allows them to sense the strength with which they are gripping, say, the mug that they’re holding and the temperature sensor sends a signal to a wrist bracelet that glows red when hot and blue when cold, allowing them to know to be careful when sipping a hot drink.
