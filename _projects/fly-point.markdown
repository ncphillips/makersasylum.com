Given the natural tendency of people to throw waste in already littered areas especially due to the sever lack of dumpsters and dustbins, Fly Point is a system that helps mark out appropriate dump spots by placing tall markers called Fly Points. These will be easy to spot and intelligently spread out, thereby preventing the creation of new litter spots. Once people adopt the concept and the behavioral change is noticeable, the number of Fly Points can be reduced, as people will know to look for the markers rather than throw their waste wherever they see fit.
