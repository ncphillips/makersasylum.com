Championizer is a game aimed at educating the underprivileged on health and safety. The two to six player board game is composed of cards, questions, and answers. Players go through a fun path that makes the gameplay more creative and innovative, thereby helping children to share ideas. The questions could be contextual or involve activities, and are based on topics such as hygiene and safety.
