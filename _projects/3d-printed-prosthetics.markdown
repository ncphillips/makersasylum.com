Claire's prosthetic arm is finally ready to be tested. It took a couple iterations, but luckily for us 3D printing makes it relatively easy to try out ideas to see if they work, and move on if they don't. Between experimenting with supports, very precise measurements, and hacking together PVC pipes, this has been an interesting project.
