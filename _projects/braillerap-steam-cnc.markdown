This project involved hacking a CNC router to print/emboss braille on various materials such as plastic, paper, metal sheets, etc. The projectâ€™s two main challenges were modifying the spindle head to be fitted with a nail that would emboss the braille, and the understanding the functioning of the existing CNC router before making the required alterations.
