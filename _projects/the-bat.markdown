The BAT is a low cost wrist wearable intended to aid the visually impaired. The wearable is fitted with a Six Axis feedback mechanism to alert the user of oncoming obstacles through vibrations ensuring an easier and less obtrusive way to navigate public areas. A future modification is to incorporate similar sensors in a pair of gloves for improved utility.
