Garbage CAN is an idea that is based on visually re-defining what segregation bins should look like. For example a plastic wrappers only bin should look like a bag of crisps. The bins will also be interactive and will respond to how well you are segregating waste by lighting up and outputting appropriate sounds when the right type of waste is inserted into it.
