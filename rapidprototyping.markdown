3D Printing and other digital prototyping tools are now buzzwords in the creative world. At Makerâ€™s Asylum Fab lab, we have launched a weekends-only course to give a working knowledge of tool training.

Day 1: Basics of electronics and Arduino
Day 2: CAD Software
Day 3: 3D Printing
Day 4: Power tools like power drill, angle grinders and jig saw
Day 5: Laser Cutting and CNC Router 
Day 6: Project build time

This looks like a crash course on tools - but it is really about getting you started on that dream project you've wanted to build. You'll learn from experts who'll be there to guide you through the sessions. It doesn't matter if you've got rudimentary or no technical knowledge. We will begin at the basics. And then off you go on your journey of innovation and tinkering.

Just bring your attitude, lap top and lunch boxes. All materials, tools and insights for the sessions are on us.

T&C: Cancellations and refund request accepted only 72 hrs prior to the workshop.
