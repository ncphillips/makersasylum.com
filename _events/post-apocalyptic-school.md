  content: "A group of ET’s from a distant galaxy have had an eye on Maker’s Asylum
    for a while. In their quest to take over this planet and its resources they have
    spread a **deadly virus** which has turned the members of Maker’s Asylum into
    **Zombies**. Everyone here is now after your dear **life**. Chaos is everywhere.
    These zombies only understand one language, the one of terror and nightmares.
    They feed on anything and everything including humans. Their weakness? They don’t
    have eyelids and cannot bear the harsh rays of Sun. But, once the darkness seeps
    in they crawl out in numbers one after the other in hundreds in search of warm
    blooded humans to feed on. They are the walking-dead, creeping across streets
    hunting down humans, turning them into zombies and multiplying their count.\n\n
    \ \nYour mission as a participant of the **Post Apocalyptic School** is to organise
    all living beings and look after your’s and their survival using the new skills
    you learn and resources to maneuver through Maker’s Asylum to your extraction
    point."
