    ## What Junior's will learn?

    The learning modules are a result of a burning curiosity towards integrating technology in learning new skills. Participants get to learn how these novel technologies work and what all goes into it from scratch in a **hands-on**, **fun**, **playful** and an **open** **environment**, which supports a child’s nature for picking up new skills.

    Core learning values such as team work, learning by observation, identifying problems, tackling challenges are subtly embedded in the programs learning modules.
