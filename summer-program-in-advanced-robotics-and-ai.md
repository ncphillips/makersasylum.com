    # **Program framework**

    The programs learning modules are a result of a burning curiosity towards integrating technology in learning new skills. Participants get to learn how these technologies work and what all goes into it from scratch in a **fun**, **playful** and an **open** **environment**, all of which supports a child’s nature for picking up new skills. Core learning values are subtly embedded in the programs structure.

    On successful completion, the participants will have learnt:

     1. The science and technology behind Robotics and AI
     2. 3D printing technology
     3. How to code
     4. Basics of electronics and applications of an Arduino board
     5. How to be efficient hackers of any designed system
     6. How to use tools to achieve desired tasks
     7. How to tackle unforeseen challenges
     8. How to work in a team
     9. How to chalk their own goals
    10. How to evaluate their own progress when learning new skills
