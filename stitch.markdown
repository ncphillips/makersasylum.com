      drawing on paper is the simplest.

#STiTCH is devised on 3Cs - conceptualise, collaborate & co-create. The first session of #STiTCH was launched in Singapore for a select group of students and is now being presented in India. To give the best immersive experience to the participants, we will be enrolling only 30 students per session.

Participants will work in teams and create prototypes incorporating all the learnings and can choose from an array of available tools, components and materials. The emphasis is to think+build. The key is to deliver a prototype that could be wild and whacky but built from ideas conceptualised by the participants, not by the mentors and experts.

This brings in aspects of interdisciplinary learning which is now gaining currency globally.
