## Woodworking (Mumbai)

The versatility and strength of #wood allows it to be used for constructing houses, boats, guitars, cabinets, and more. First, participants will be introduced to wood: #grain, #orientation, and #strength. Next, you will be taught how to build a laptop table or bedside table, which you get to take back home! Over the course, you will gain familiarity with the #saw, #chisel, #hammer, etc.

Our goal is to make sure each participant walks away a master in basic wood #joinery, as well as the confidence to continue their tinkering and exploration with wood. All necessary materials will be provided.

#### Schedule:

Day 1: Introduction and cutting wood to size
Day 2: Joinery, dry fitting and final assembly
Day 3: Polish and finish
Day 4: Spillover

#### About the Instructor:

Viren Vaz of V for Wood is a software professional by day and a tinkerer by night. He is living proof that even a small home in Mumbai can turn into a woodworking workshop as he’s being doing this for the past 7 years. Over the years, working from 10pm to midnight, he has churned out furniture ranging from small shoe racks to a large 7-by-6 feet bed. He also makes wooden puzzles and miniature furniture, and is obsessed with designs that do not need metal fasteners. Viren can also repair a leaky tap, replace a switchboard and bake a cake. He hopes to add pottery and working leather to his list of skills.

## Woodworking (Delhi)

The craft of #woodworking has existed for centuries, but only recently has it become an easy to learn hobby. #PowerTools like the #CircularSaw, #Jigsaw, and #Sander, have revolutionized the craft; no longer does it take many days to create a simple chair.

In this full-day workshop, Sulakshana of MishtooMade, will teach participants how to use a selection of popular power tools, including those mentioned above, to make a chic serving tray to take home.

Participants will learn about the properties of various materials including timber, plywood, particleboard, and MDF, as well as how to machine them using power tools. All required materials will be provided at the space.
