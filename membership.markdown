    **Tool Training:** while membership gives you access to the space – safety is our primary concern – all members MUST be trained and tested on all power tools, machines and certain electronic equipment by a makerspace instructor before you can use them.

    Our Rapid Prototyping Course happens on a monthly basis to equip you with everything you need to know about our tools and certify you on good practices. Then you can use the tools yourself anytime. :)
