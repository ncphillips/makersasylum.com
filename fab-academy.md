  content: It was developed to teach hands-on skills in fab labs which began as an
    outreach project from MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms and has grown into a global
    network of more than 500 labs. Fab Academy instruction is based on MIT’s popular
    rapid-prototyping course **How To Make (almost) Anything**, both taught by Prof.
    Neil Gershenfeld.

    **Fab Academy** is a distributed educational model providing a unique educational experience.

    Each Fab Lab that participates in the Fab Academy program (see list [here](http://fabacademy.org/2017-nodes-supernodes/)) is part of a global Fab Lab / Fab Academy network. These Fab Labs are Nodes that offer the Fab Academy program.

    Students view and participate in global lectures broadcasted every Wednesdays at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST. The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester. In addition to the lectures, there are 2 / 3 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects. Each Fab Lab will establish the schedule for these Lab days.

    Fab Academy faculty, who are leaders in their respective fields, provide global video lectures, supervise academic content, and guide research. Hands-on instruction in the labs is provided by instructors who supervise and evaluate Certificates, develop and disseminate instructional material, and assist with projects.
