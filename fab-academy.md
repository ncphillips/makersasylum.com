  content: It was developed to teach hands-on skills in fab labs which began as an
    outreach project from MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms and has grown into a global
    network of more than 500 labs. Fab Academy instruction is based on MIT’s popular
    rapid-prototyping course **How To Make (almost) Anything**, both taught by Prof.
    Neil Gershenfeld.
