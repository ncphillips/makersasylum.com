Maker’s Asylum is a community space focussed on fostering innovation through hands on learning. It also provides access to an ecosystem of stakeholders which includes Governments, Businesses, Incubators/Accelerators, Investors and subject matter experts. The space houses various labs that are co-located in order facilitate prototyping of ideas that are interdisciplinary in nature.

This ​space started out of a garage in Bandra (Mumbai) 5 years ago, in fact one of the first makerspaces in the country and has now become a popular community space to build prototypes, products etc and also houses the community of artists, designers, engineers who are building indigenous products. Here is a link to the story of the evolution in case you would like to take a look ​[https://www.makersasylum.com/our-story/​](https://www.makersasylum.com/our-story/​).

Maker’s Asylum has its ​flagship spaces located in ​Mumbai and Delhi and in October 2018 it launched the third space in ​collaboration with the French Embassy in Jaipur​​. The Jaipur Textile Lab for Women as the name suggests is created to support the women artisans in and around Jaipur and will focus on research on smart textiles, sustainable textiles, natural/organic dyes and integration of digital fabrication tools in traditional processes.

Maker’s Asylum has also been running its ​annual flagship program STEAM School - a ​project based learning program in collaboration with its French partners, the ​Center of Research & Interdisciplinarity and the French Embassy since 2016 in India which is focussed on bringing together various stakeholders which include, entrepreneurs, students, universities and corporate organisations, to work on solving problems that aligned to the ​United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Every year this program hosts about 100 young leaders from across the world and Maker’s Asylum will be hosting the same in different countries starting 2019. The STEAM School was also one of the 14 initiatives that was presented to the French President and his wife​​, Emmanuel & Brigitte Macron, during their recent visit to India in May 2018.

Maker’s Asylum has also been engaged in working with the differently abled community through its program STEAM Fabrikarium​​. Projects such as Flying wheelchairs for paraplegics have been designed during this program and are now being tested in other countries currently. In February 2018, 15 differently abled individuals came together as participants for this program and spent 5 days working with the other participants on projects such as bionic hands, braille printer and cosmetic prosthetic hands.

Maker's Asylum will be focussed on driving community engagement under our two verticals - Access to Infrastructure (via tools/equipments) and Access to Education (under the brand of STEAM School). Maker's Asylum Junior will also be integrated as part of our community space (which has already started) and will focus on alternative learning for kids. Our goal is to eventually become an Open University where crazy ideas can thrive and break the barriers of traditional thought/methodology of education.

Few notable partners of Maker’s Asylum in the past : Godrej, Airbus, Dassault Systemes, Autodesk, Renault Groupe, Naval Group, emlyon Business School, Institut Mines-Telecom (Consortium of French Engineering universities), ISDI, UNESCO, Fab Foundation, Center of Research and Interdisciplinarity, Paris.
