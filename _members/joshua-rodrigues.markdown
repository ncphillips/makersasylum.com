Joshua Rodrigues got into making a few years ago & found a profound taste for it. He believes in learning by making, taking things apart & assembling it back together or completely breaking it. The love for tools & getting his hands dirty  brought him to the Asylum. He reveres the interaction with the community & learning from other makers.
