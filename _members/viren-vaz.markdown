Viren can best be described as a software professional by day and a tinkerer by night. Working from 10PM to midnight he has over the years turned out items of furniture ranging from a small shoe rack to a large 7Ã—6 foot bed. He also makes wood puzzles and miniature furniture and is obsessed with designs that do not need metal fasteners.
In addition to working wood, Viren can also repair a leaky tap, replace a switchboard and bake a cake. He hopes to add pottery and working leather to the list.
