Viren can best be described as a software professional by day and a tinkerer by night. Working from 10PM to midnight he has over the years turned out items of furniture ranging from a small shoe rack to a large 7×6 foot bed. He also makes wood puzzles and miniature furniture and is obsessed with designs that do not need metal fasteners.
In addition to working wood, Viren can also repair a leaky tap, replace a switchboard and bake a cake. He hopes to add pottery and working leather to the list.
