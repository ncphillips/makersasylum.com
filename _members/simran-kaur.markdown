Simran is a light heartâ€™ed passionate individual, who want nothing but to see the world in chaos, the chaos we fear from the life of this conformity.
She got first hand experience by pursuing B.Com. from DU, only to realize that may be it is imperative to think about economy, transaction and all that we(including her!) run towards. But to what scale and in what priority and at what cost? Being a Delhiite, she has had her share of these marathons. These days she tries to find meaning in art, experiences and love.
