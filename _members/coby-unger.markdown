Most often, Coby Unger can be found in his natural habitat of the work shop or on a feeding frenzy of either egg masala and roti or a bagel with cream cheese and a hot cup of coffee. He considers his Leatherman multi tool an extension of his being and is rarely found without it. Coby has been making and building from a young age. He has been working to share that passion with others since he was in college at Philadelphia University and working with Public Workshop on various design-build projects. Never one for doing things the traditional way, he embraced the spirit of Jugaaad long before moving to india and learning there was an official term for it.
