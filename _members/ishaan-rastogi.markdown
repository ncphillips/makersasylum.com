Ishaan is an engineering graduate who quit his dream job as an automotive journalist last year. He felt his varied skills would be of better use in an environment that lifted the confines of a standard desk job from his shoulders. As a result, he joined Makerâ€™s Asylum in an ambiguous capacity that enabled him to think freely. He finally found his foothold as a Curator for the Asylum and now helps ideate and develop new projects and events, besides helping the team out with his vast content experience when required. He loves a good game of tennis and is a keen traveler who finds long drives to be therapeutic rather than a chore!
