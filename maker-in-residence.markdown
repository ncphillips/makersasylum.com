## Maker in Residence

We are looking for people who want to create something socially productive. If you have a passion for making and innovative ideas, we’ll give you tools and space to make your ideas happen.

We are also looking for sponsors - corporate or otherwise, who want to fuel Indian innovation. If your company is interested in sponsoring a specific type of project, we’re more than happy to work with our applicants to make it happen.

Our residency program ranges from 4-12 months, depending on the project. We provide the space to make and the tools to build with, as well as funding for your project. In return, we expect you to teach a few workshops, and most importantly - make something great!

As part of the program, Resident Makers will receive:

* Training & unlimited access to all the tools & equipment at the Asylum.

* Guidance and support in sourcing material from local vendors.

* A dedicated space to work.

* Various platforms to showcase their work - either through workshops or exhibitions.

* We believe in contributing to the open-source community, so we recommend that our Resident Makers document and share their work publicly. However, all IP related to the project will belong to them, as will the physical project.

Responsibilities:

* We expect all our Resident Makers to give back to the community in some way, either through teaching and conducting workshops, or through joining collaborative projects and helping other members.

* At the end of the residency, we expect to see some amazing projects that fulfil an important urban need, that have been well-documented for the purpose of future research.

Application Procedure:

* STEP 1: Send an email to [info@makersasylum.com](mailto:info@makersasylum.com) introducing yourself and briefly describe your project. If we like what we see, we’ll ask you to then send some of your previous work (websites, PDF portfolios, blog posts, papers, presentations, etc) as well as a more detailed project proposal.

* STEP 2: After we’ve seen some of your past work and considered your project proposal, we’ll have a better understanding of how we can pair you up with sponsors to fund the project. At this stage, we’ll work together to come up with a proposed timeline and budget.
